# King of sword
### You can play here
- https://rmnmrn.itch.io/king-of-sword

**Zenject**, **R3** and **DOTween** are used as external extensions. 
The game is localized and supports different types of saves.


It's an arcade where you can either parry or attack.
But either of these actions can lead to your defeat: when you attack, you open yourself up to be hit, 
and when you parry, you get pushed back until you fall from the arena.
